# Simple ESNtest for future Web Developers or for playing a bit

The purpose of this repository is to test the skills of our future
developers or our current ITcom members and see how they solve some
basic html and php task, how they manage to face the code by reading
the provided documentation and existing functions and evaluate their
coding skills and use of coding standards (we follow Drupal standards).

But anyone can clone this repo and start it, there is no limitation.

## Requirements
This test has been done with pure php code, not by using frameworks or docker.
You just need PHP8.1 and composer2.
For easy-deploy & configuration, we recommend to have DDEV installed in your
setup (MacOS, Linux, WSL, etc...).
For XAMPP installations, all should be good if you have PHP8.1 too.
