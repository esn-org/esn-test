# Simple ESNtest for future Web Developers or for playing a bit

The purpose of this repository is to test the skills of our future
developers or our current ITcom members and see how they solve some
basic html and php task, how they manage to face the code by reading
the provided documentation and existing functions and evaluate their
coding skills and use of coding standards (we follow Drupal standards).

But anyone can clone this repo and start it, there is no limitation.

## System requirements 

This test is configured for the following requirements:

- Webserver: Apache 2.4.7 or higher / Nginx 1.9.x or higher
- PHP: 8.1
- Composer: 2.5 or higher

As we primarely recommend DDEV for development, all the system requirements are
covered if you use it, as the needed configuration is already defined.

### Development environment 
In order to have a working dev environment compatible with this, the fastest and
recommended option is to install [DDEV](https://github.com/ddev/ddev) (compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS).
You will also need to have docker installed in your computer, as it is required by
DDEV. For that, we recommend [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

In addition, for Windows only, you will need to have WSL2 installed and enabled.
Make sure your computer is compatible with WLS before installing the rest of the programs, otherwise
you will need to install other tools (e.g: WAMPP, or similar).

Once you have WSL2 installed (you can follow this [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)),
you can proceed to install DDEV as stated in [its documentation page](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) based
on the OS of your computer.
Once you have finished, you should have almost everything for start developing on this project

### DDEV and composer
DDEV provides a built-in command to simplify use of PHPâ€™s dependency manager, Composer, without requiring it to be installed on the host machine. Generally, executing any Composer command through DDEV is as simple as prepending the command with ddev.
If you have any question, you can read more about in in the [DDEV documentation page](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/developer-tools/#ddev-and-composer).

**Please read the additional instructions of DDEV related to Firefox or certificates, as you might have some issues
if you use that browser.**
